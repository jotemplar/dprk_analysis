# DPRK Image Analysis Project Objectives

## Primary Mission
Document and analyze visual evidence of North Korean nationals' living and working conditions in Russia, with focus on humanitarian concerns and potential human rights issues.

## Research Context
This project systematically collects and analyzes publicly available images to identify patterns of concern regarding the treatment and conditions of North Korean workers in Russia. The analysis aims to provide objective documentation of observable conditions that may indicate exploitation, unsafe practices, or substandard living situations.

## Key Indicators to Identify

### Working Conditions
- **Safety Equipment Deficiencies**
  - Absence of helmets on construction sites
  - Missing harnesses when working at heights
  - Lack of protective clothing in hazardous environments
  - Inadequate footwear for industrial work

- **Environmental Hazards**
  - Work in extreme weather without proper protection
  - Exposure to dangerous machinery without safeguards
  - Construction sites with visible safety violations
  - Poor lighting or visibility conditions

- **Physical Strain Indicators**
  - Signs of exhaustion or fatigue
  - Workers in physically demanding positions
  - Evidence of continuous work without breaks
  - Inadequate tools requiring excessive manual effort

### Living Conditions

- **Housing Quality**
  - Overcrowded dormitories (multiple beds per small room)
  - Temporary or makeshift structures
  - Deteriorated buildings with visible damage
  - Inadequate heating/cooling systems
  - Poor sanitation facilities

- **Isolation Indicators**
  - Remote locations away from population centers
  - Fenced or walled compounds
  - Limited windows or natural light
  - Absence of recreational spaces
  - No visible personal belongings or customization

### Supervision & Control

- **Direct Supervision**
  - Presence of uniformed guards or handlers
  - Workers accompanied by non-working supervisors
  - Group formations suggesting controlled movement
  - Escorts during transportation

- **Restriction Indicators**
  - Perimeter fencing with restricted access points
  - Surveillance cameras or watchtowers
  - Controlled entry/exit points
  - Barbed wire or other containment measures
  - Workers in uniform groups without individual movement

### Health & Welfare

- **Physical Health Concerns**
  - Visible signs of malnutrition (thin appearance)
  - Injuries without proper medical attention
  - Inadequate clothing for weather conditions
  - Signs of illness or untreated conditions
  - Evidence of physical exhaustion

- **Welfare Deficiencies**
  - Lack of rest areas or break facilities
  - No visible medical facilities
  - Absence of safety signage or equipment
  - Working in dangerous conditions without training evidence
  - No protective measures against occupational hazards

## Analysis Priorities

### Critical Concern (Immediate Documentation Required)
- Evidence of physical abuse or violence
- Severe safety violations with imminent danger
- Extreme overcrowding or uninhabitable conditions
- Clear evidence of forced labor indicators
- Medical emergencies without treatment

### High Concern
- Systematic safety equipment absence
- Controlled movement with guards
- Severely deteriorated living conditions
- Multiple indicators of exploitation
- Harsh weather exposure without protection

### Medium Concern
- Some safety deficiencies
- Crowded but functional living spaces
- Supervision without obvious restriction
- Isolated locations with basic amenities
- Signs of difficult but not dangerous conditions

### Low Concern
- Minor safety improvements needed
- Basic but adequate facilities
- Normal workplace supervision
- Some isolation but with community access
- Challenging but standard working conditions

## Documentation Standards

### Evidence Requirements
- Clear visual documentation of conditions
- Multiple angles or instances when possible
- Context showing scale and environment
- Comparison with standard practices
- Pattern identification across multiple sources

### Objectivity Principles
- Focus on observable conditions
- Avoid speculation beyond visual evidence
- Document both concerning and normal conditions
- Note limitations of visual analysis
- Acknowledge when evidence is inconclusive

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- Blur or obscure individual faces when possible
- Focus on conditions rather than individuals
- Protect identity of specific persons
- Avoid creating additional risk for subjects

### Responsible Analysis
- Maintain humanitarian focus
- Avoid sensationalization
- Present findings objectively
- Consider multiple interpretations
- Acknowledge analysis limitations

## Project Outcomes

### Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive image database with categorized concerns
2. Statistical analysis of condition patterns
3. Geographic distribution of identified concerns
4. Temporal trends in working/living conditions
5. Comparative analysis with international labor standards

### Impact Goals
- Raise awareness of humanitarian concerns
- Provide evidence for advocacy efforts
- Support policy discussions on labor practices
- Contribute to international monitoring efforts
- Document patterns requiring intervention

## Technical Implementation

### Analysis Models
- **Primary (llava)**: Visual scene understanding and detail extraction
- **Secondary (gemma3n:e4b)**: Humanitarian perspective and textual reasoning
- **Ensemble**: Combined analysis for higher confidence in findings

### Confidence Metrics
- Agreement between models increases confidence
- Multiple indicators strengthen concern classification
- Pattern recognition across multiple images
- Consistency with known information

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Integration
- Regular review of classification accuracy
- Adjustment of prompts based on findings
- Incorporation of new indicator categories
- Refinement of concern level thresholds

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-validation between models
- Human review of critical findings
- Documentation of edge cases
- Regular calibration of analysis parameters
